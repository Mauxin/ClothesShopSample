# ClothesShopSample
A little 2D clothes shop sample for sim-like game

In this Sample made in 48h but about 6h of development in a middle of more conturbated week that I though it will be.

I developed this little shop game mechanic where the player can walk up, down, left and right using WASD and interact with the shopkeeper
using E.

Know Issues:
- Purchase and Sell screen are not updating after Actions (You should close all the shop screen and interact with shopkeeper again to see the update)
this happens because the lack of events implemented for these updates

- Not Equipping any Item, this is a not implemented feature due to lack of time
- Not Opening an Inventory Screen, this is a not implemented feature due to lack of time, anyway we can use the "sell screen" as inventory to check.
